### Objective (What): What did we learn today
- We learnt how to apply test-driven development (TDD) when we are developing a feature.

### Refective (Gut): Use one word to express your feelings about today's class
- TDD allows us to understand the edge cases better before the development starts, which makes the development easier.

### Interpretive (So What): What was the most meaningful aspect of this activity
- This lesson makes me understand it is important to write test case before the implmentation happened because if you ever need to refactor the code again, the test cases allow you to know what went wrong with your new code.

### Decisional (Now What): Where do you most want to apply what you have learned today
- I will make sure that I have unit tests ready before refactoring the code to make sure the refactored code is working as expected.
- I will apply TDD when developing a feature in order to make sure the code is worked as expected.
